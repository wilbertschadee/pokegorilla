                Hello there! Welcome to the world of POKEMON! My name is OAK!
                People call me the POKEMON PROF!
                </p>
                <p>
                This world is inhabited by creatures called POKEMON! For some
                people, POKEMON are pets. Others use them for fights. Myself...
                I study POKEMON as a profession.
